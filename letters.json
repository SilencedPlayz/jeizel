      "Everyday, till now, I'm still traumatized, feels so heavy, comparing myself to your new lover, and how you're sexually aroused to him. I don't know what to do but just accept it all and endure it all forever. I know it's all my fault, and I know I'm just ugly, pathetic, and have an unattractive body and mindset. Therefore, I just want to remove this feeling and trauma, but since I can't remove this, I just want to bump my head always or just die. Because seeing you with someone else, and seeing you doing sexual things with others, even for a guy you just met, is a great torment for me that I will not be able to bear. I agreed to leave for a reason, not to let yourself get caught by the spark and entertainment from others when we were still together. I know you've cheated on me even if it's just merely chat. I don't know what can I do but to just suffer everyday until its more than you suffered when you're still with me, because I know you will never help me fix this in a proper way, and I know im easily replaced and you already put all your love to someone else.",
